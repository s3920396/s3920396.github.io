// this is a page to store all the cards for the card game. I need to repeat the names twices. Hoever this only gave 6 cards so I duplicated the card names again to get enough cards.
// This works on a practically level for array. But in future assets I should use figure out some way to simplify it, like how in class excerises we just called the assets folder.
// the png assets (king, jack,queen,cloud and like) being used here come from Rmit modules, partically from the Rohit's card game examples we did. As we had to code dragging and clicking interacting using these cards. 
// I felt for my project it will be easier using assets I had in modules than trying to make new ones from scratch.

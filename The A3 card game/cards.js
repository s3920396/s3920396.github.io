// this is a page to store all the cards for the card game. I need to repeat the names twices. Hoever this only gave 6 cards so I duplicated the card names again to get enough cards.
// This works on a practically level for array. But in future assets I should use figure out some way to simplify it, like how in class excerises we just called the assets folder.
const cardArray = [
    {
        name: "king",
        img: "assets/king.png"
    },
     {
        name: "king",
        img: "assets/king.png"
    },
       {
        name: "queen",
        img: "assets/queen.png"
    },
     {
        name: "queen",
        img: "assets/queen.png"

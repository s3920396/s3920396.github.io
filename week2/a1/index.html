          <li>The first thing I saw in the website was the scrollable panning shot of the concert hall.</li>
        <li>The title text squishes and streches, the auto play videos of Frank talking about parts of concert hall and scroll text.</li>
        <li>I spent alot of the time reading the descriptions alongside images of the concert hall.</li>
        <li>The most common action was repeatedly swipping on the scroll wheel to move up and down the app.</li>
        <li>The brand of Walt Disney was what interested me into engaging with this website. But didn't have much interest in architecture.</li>
       <li>This goal of understanding the contruct of the Disney concert hall is done through stock footage and paragraphs of text.</li>
